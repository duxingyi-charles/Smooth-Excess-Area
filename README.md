## Abstract

Injective parameterizations of triangulated meshes are critical across applications but remain challenging to compute. Existing algorithms to find injectivity either require initialization from an injective starting state, which is currently only possible without positional constraints, or else can only prevent triangle inversion, which is insufficient to ensure injectivity. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first algorithm for recovering a globally injective parameterization from an arbitrary non-injective initial mesh subject to stationary constraints. These initial meshes can be inverted, wound about interior vertices and/or overlapping. Our algorithm in turn enables globally injective mapping for meshes with arbitrary positional constraints. Our key contribution is a new energy, called smooth excess area (**SEA**), that measures non-injectivity in a map. This energy is well-defined across both injective and non-injective maps and is smooth almost everywhere, making it readily minimizable using standard gradient-based solvers starting from a non-injective initial state. Importantly, we show that maps minimizing SEA are guaranteed to be locally injective and almost globally injective, in the sense that the overlapping area can be made arbitrarily small. Analyzing SEAâ€™s behavior over a new benchmark set designed to test injective mapping, we find that optimizing SEA successfully recovers globally injective maps for 85% of the benchmark and obtains locally injective maps for 90%. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods for removing triangle inversion obtain locally injective maps for less than 6% of the benchmark, and achieve global injectivity (largely by chance as prior methods are not designed to recover it) on less than 4%.

## SEA-QN

![](figure/overview.png)

Here we release SEA-QN, a program that computes injective mapping under positional constraints by minimizing SEA (Smooth Excess Area) energy using quasi-Newton method.

The above figure illustrates **what SEA does**. It takes as input a source mesh, a group of positional constraints and a non-injective initial map, and outputs an injective map satisfying the positional constraints.

This program has been tested on macOS 12.0.1 (Apple Clang 13.0.0.13000029) and Windows 10 (Visual Studio Community 2022).

## Build


### Mac

In terminal, navigate to our main directory, and run the following commands: 

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make -j

The program `SEA_QN` will be generated in the `build` subdirectory.

### Windows

Open the folder containing CMakeLists.txt from visual studio. A cmake project will be configured and then you can build the program `SEA_QN.exe` in visual studio.

### Add support for MaxIteration termination criterion

:bell:  **Important**:
We use [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (version 2.7.0)'s L-BFGS quasi-Newton solver for optimization. This implementation doesn't track L-BFGS iterations, so it doesn't natively support the maxIteration termination criterion. To support this termination criterion, you need to replace the NLopt source file `_deps/nlopt-src/src/algs/luksan/plis.c` by the file [`plis.c`](LBFGS_iteration_count/plis.c) we provide in the folder `LBFGS_iteration_count`. You need to rebuild the program for this change to take effect.

## How to use

The executable `SEA_QN` asks for 3 arguments: path to an input data file, path to a solver options file, and path to the file to store the result.

    ./SEA_QN [input_file] [solver_options_file] [result_file]

An example is provided in the `example` subdirectory. Test it by:

    ./SEA_QN example/input example/solver_options example/my_result

The result will be written to `example/my_result`.

In the 3 arguments, `input_file` is mandatory, while the rest two are optional. If `solver_options_file` is not specified, `SEA_QN` will look for a file named `solver_options` in the same directory as the binary. If that file is not found, the program will fall back to default options. If `result_file` is not given, results will be written to a file named `result` in the directory of the binary.


## File format

### input_file

_Input file_ contains vertices and faces(i.e. triangles) information about the source mesh and initial embedding, as well as the indices of constrained vertices (called handles or positional constraints). Vertices are indexed from 0.


    [num_sourceVert] [dimension_sourceVert]
    ... (num_sourceVert * dimension_sourceVert) Matrix ...
    [num_initVert]   [dimension_initVert]
    ... (num_initVert * dimension_initVert) Matrix ...
    [num_simplex]    [simplex_size]
    ... (num_simplex * simplex_size) Matrix ...
    [num_handles]
    ... (num_handles * 1) Matrix ...
 
 See [`example/input`](example/input) for a concrete example.
 
 
:tada: **It's possible to use standard mesh formats.** We provide a python script in directory `IO` to convert OBJ mesh formats to our `input_file` format.
 
 To use the script, make sure to install [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) with
 
     pip install meshio
 
 To convert triangle meshes to our input format, run
 
    ./convert_input_2D.py [inputObjFile] [handleFile] [outFile]
 
 Currently, we only support OBJ file with initial mesh as uv coordinates. Check out our [dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5547887) for some concrete OBJ and handle files. The `handleFile` contains a list of indices of constrainded vertices (indexed from 0).
 The generated `outFile` will have the format of our `input_file`.

 
### solver_options_file

_Solver options file_ contains parameters for SEA energy, options for NLopt solver, and a list of intermediate status to record during optimization.
